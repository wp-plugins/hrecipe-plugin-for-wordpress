== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is a microformat? =

There are different microformats for different types of
information. This plugin uses the hReview microformat for review type
information. For more information, see to <a
href="http://microformats.org">the main microformats site</a>.

= Why would I want to use this? =


Since hRecipe plugin used hReview plugin code, here's
the explanation for hReview:

If your reviews are displayed on your blog using the hReview
microformat, it makes it easy for search engines to find and do
special things with them. For example, there is a <a
href="http://kitchen.technorati.com/review/search/">reviews search
engine run by Technorati.</a>
